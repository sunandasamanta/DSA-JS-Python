# Linked List - A Linear Data Structure

A linked list is a linear data structure that consists of a chain of nodes, where each node contains a value and a reference to the next node. The first node is called the head and the last node is called the tail. A linked list can be singly-linked, where each node only points to the next node, or doubly-linked, where each node points to the next and previous nodes.

A linked list has several properties that make it useful for solving many types of problems:

1. **Dynamic Size**: A linked list can grow or shrink in size dynamically, as elements are added or removed. This allows for efficient memory usage, as memory is only allocated for the elements that are currently in the list.

1. **Insertion and Deletion**: Inserting and deleting elements from a linked list can be done in constant time, as it only requires updating the references of the surrounding nodes.

1. **Singly-Linked and Doubly-Linked**: A linked list can be implemented as a singly-linked list, where each node only points to the next node, or as a doubly-linked list, where each node points to the next and previous nodes. This allows for more flexibility in certain operations.

1. **Traversal**: Traversing a linked list involves following the references from one node to the next, which allows for efficient access to elements in any position.

1. **Practical Applications**: Linked lists are used in many applications such as maintaining a history of recently visited web pages, implementing undo/redo functionality and in the implementation of other data structures such as stack, queue and many more.

1. **Implementation**: Linked lists can be implemented using various programming languages, and it has its own advantages and disadvantages depending on the application.

An example of a linked list is a playlist in music player application. Each song in the playlist is a node, and each node has a reference to the next song in the playlist, in this case, it's a singly-linked list. By using linked list, it's easy to add or delete a song from the playlist without affecting the other songs.

In summary, a linked list is a linear data structure that consists of a chain of nodes, where each node contains a value and a reference to the next node. It's a dynamic data structure that allows for efficient memory usage, insertion and deletion of elements, and traversal. Linked lists are widely used in many applications such as maintaining a history of recently visited web pages, implementing undo/redo functionality and many more.
