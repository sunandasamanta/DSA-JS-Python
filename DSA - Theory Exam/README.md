1. **What is the time complexity of the bubble sort algorithm?**\
**Ans**.Bubble sort is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list to be sorted, compares each pair of adjacent items and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. The pass through the list is repeated until no swaps are needed, which indicates that the list is sorted. The algorithm, which is a comparison sort, is named for the way smaller or larger elements "bubble" to the top of the list as the larger elements "sink" to the bottom.

    Here's how the bubble sort algorithm works:

    1. **Compare**: The algorithm compares the first and second elements of the list. If the first element is larger than the second, they are swapped.

    1. **Move**: The algorithm moves to the next pair of elements and repeats step 1.

    1. **Repeat**: The algorithm repeats steps 1 and 2 for the entire length of the list.

    1. **Check**: The algorithm then checks if any swap has been made in the last pass, if not the list is already sorted and no further passes are needed. If any swap was made, the algorithm repeats steps 1 to 3 again.

    Here's an example of how bubble sort algorithm works on the following list:
        [8, 5, 2, 9, 5, 6, 3]


        1st pass: [5, 2, 8, 5, 6, 3, 9]  (8 and 5 swapped)
        2nd pass: [2, 5, 5, 3, 6, 8, 9]  (8 and 2 swapped, 5 and 5 not swapped)
        3rd pass: [2, 5, 3, 5, 6, 8, 9]  (5 and 3 swapped)
        4th pass: [2, 3, 5, 5, 6, 8, 9]  (5 and 5 not swapped)
        5th pass: [2, 3, 5, 5, 6, 8, 9]  (no swap made)
    As we can see, after 5th pass, no swap is made which indicates that the list is sorted and the algorithm stops.

    The time complexity of bubble sort is O(<sup>2</sup>) in the worst and average case, and O(n) in the best case (when the list is already sorted). This makes bubble sort not the best choice for large lists or when performance is a concern. But bubble sort is still simple and easy to understand, which makes it useful for educational purpose and small lists.
    
1. **What is the advantage of using a hash table over an array?**\
**Ans**. The main advantage of using a hash table over an array is that it allows for efficient searching, insertion, and deletion of elements based on keys.

    **Efficient searching**: Hash tables use a technique called hashing which allows for fast retrieval of elements based on their keys. Hashing functions map keys to indices in the table, making it easy to find the corresponding value in constant time (O(1)) on average.

    **Efficient insertion**: Hash tables also allow for efficient insertion of elements by using open addressing or chaining techniques to handle collisions, which occur when two keys are mapped to the same index. Insertion in an array can be O(n) in worst case if the array needs to be resized and rehashed.

    **Efficient deletion**: Hash tables also allow for efficient deletion of elements by simply removing the key-value pair from the table.

    **Dynamic resizing**: A Hash table can automatically increase or decrease its size as the number of elements in the table changes, which makes it more memory efficient.

    **Flexibility**: Hash tables are not limited by indices, unlike arrays, and can be used to store elements of any data type as keys.

    In summary, Hash tables provide constant-time average-case performance for searching, insertion, and deletion operations, which makes them more efficient than arrays in many cases.

1. **What is the difference between a stack and a queue?**\
**Ans**. A stack and a queue are both linear data structures, but they have different ways of accessing elements.

    **Stack**: A stack is a last-in-first-out (LIFO) data structure, meaning that the last element added to the stack is the first one to be removed. It follows the principle of "Last In, First Out" (LIFO). The two main operations that can be performed on a stack are push and pop. Push operation is used to add an element to the top of the stack and the pop operation is used to remove the top element of the stack.

    **Queue**: A queue is a first-in-first-out (FIFO) data structure, meaning that the first element added to the queue is the first one to be removed. It follows the principle of "First In, First Out" (FIFO). The two main operations that can be performed on a queue are enqueue and dequeue. Enqueue operation is used to add an element to the rear of the queue and the dequeue operation is used to remove the front element of the queue.

    In summary, a stack is a LIFO data structure where elements are added and removed from the top of the stack, and a queue is a FIFO data structure where elements are added to the rear and removed from the front.
1. **How do you implement a priority queue using a binary heap?**\
**Ans**. A priority queue is a data structure that stores elements with certain priorities and allows access to the element with the highest priority. A binary heap is a complete binary tree that can be used to implement a priority queue.

    There are two types of binary heap:

    **Max-Heap**: In a max-heap, the value of each parent node is greater than or equal to the values of its children. The element with the highest priority is the root node.

    **Min-Heap**: In a min-heap, the value of each parent node is less than or equal to the values of its children. The element with the lowest priority is the root node.

    Here's how you can implement a priority queue using a binary heap:

    **Insertion**: To insert an element in a binary heap, first, add the element to the end of the heap. Then, compare the value of the new element with its parent. If the value of the new element is greater than its parent, swap the elements. Repeat this process until the value of the new element is less than or equal to its parent or it becomes the root node.

    **Deletion**: To delete the root element, first, replace the root element with the last element of the heap. Then, compare the value of the new root element with its children. If the value of the new root element is less than one of its children, swap the elements. Repeat this process until the value of the new root element is greater than or equal to its children or it becomes a leaf node.

    **Accessing the highest priority element**: To access the highest priority element, simply return the root element, which stores the highest priority element.

    **Updating priority**: To update the priority of an element, first, find the element and update its value. Then, compare the updated element with its parent and children. If the updated element has a higher priority than its parent, swap it with the parent. If the updated element has a lower priority than one of its children, swap it with the child. Repeat this process until the updated element is in the correct position.

    In summary, a binary heap is a complete binary tree, which can be used to implement a priority queue. The element with the highest priority is at the root of a max-heap and element with the lowest priority is at the root of a min-heap. Insertion, deletion and updating priority are done efficiently in log(n) time.
1. **What is the difference between a binary tree and a binary search tree?**\
**Ans**. A binary tree and a binary search tree (BST) are both tree data structures, but there are some key differences between them:

    **Structure**: A binary tree is a tree data structure in which each node can have at most two children, which are referred to as the left and right children.
    A binary search tree is a type of binary tree in which each node has a key value, and the left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys that are less than the node's key, and the right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys that are greater than the node's key.

    **Order**: In a binary tree, the ordering of nodes is not defined and nodes can be in any order. In a binary search tree, the ordering of nodes is defined by the key value of each node.

    **Searching**: Searching for a specific element in a binary tree can be time-consuming and require traversing the entire tree. In a binary search tree, searching for an element can be done in logarithmic time, as the tree is ordered and you can eliminate half of the tree in each step by comparing the current node's key value with the value being searched for.

    **Insertion** and deletion: Insertion and deletion in a binary tree can be time-consuming and may require reordering the tree. In a binary search tree, insertion and deletion can be done in logarithmic time as the tree is ordered.

    In summary, a binary tree is a tree data structure where each node can have at most two children, and a binary search tree is a type of binary tree where the ordering of nodes is defined by the key value of each node, which allows for efficient searching, insertion and deletion.

1. **What is the time complexity of the depth-first search algorithm?**\
**Ans**. The depth-first search (DFS) algorithm is a method for traversing a graph or tree data structure. It starts at the root node (or some arbitrary node) and explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking.

    The algorithm can be implemented in two ways:

    Recursive: The algorithm starts at the root node and recursively visits the left and right children of the current node, marking the node as visited when it is first encountered and backtracking when it reaches a leaf node or a node that has already been visited.

    Iterative: The algorithm uses a stack to keep track of the nodes to visit. It starts at the root node and visits the left and right children of the current node, pushing the unvisited children to the stack. When a leaf node is reached or a node that has already been visited, the algorithm pops the top element from the stack and continues the process with that node.

    The DFS algorithm can be used to:

    - Traverse a graph or tree
    - Search for a specific element in a graph or tree
    - Find a path between two nodes
    - Find the connected components of an undirected graph
    - Detect cycles in a graph
    - Topological sorting
    
    The time complexity of DFS is O(V+E) where V is the number of vertices and E is the number of edges. The space complexity is O(V) as worst case scenario DFS will have to store all the vertices in the call stack.

1. **What is the time complexity of the breadth-first search algorithm?**\
**Ans**. The breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm is a method for traversing a graph or tree data structure. It starts at the root node (or some arbitrary node) and explores all the neighboring nodes at the present depth before moving on to the nodes at the next depth level.

    The algorithm can be implemented using a queue to keep track of the nodes to visit. It starts at the root node and visits all the neighboring nodes first before moving on to the next level of nodes. The algorithm marks the node as visited when it is first encountered and adds it to the queue. The algorithm dequeues the front node from the queue and repeats the process until the queue is empty.

    The BFS algorithm can be used to:

    - Traverse a graph or tree
    - Search for a specific element in a graph or tree
    - Find the shortest path between two nodes in an unweighted graph
    - Find the connected components of an undirected graph
    - Detect cycles in an undirected graph

    The time complexity of BFS is O(V+E) where V is the number of vertices and E is the number of edges. The space complexity is O(V) as worst case scenario BFS will have to store all the vertices in the queue.
1. **What is the time complexity of the quicksort algorithm?**\
**Ans**. Quicksort is a divide-and-conquer algorithm that is used to sort an array or list of elements. It is one of the most efficient sorting algorithms with an average time complexity of O(n log n).

    Here is how the quicksort algorithm works:
    1. **Select a pivot element**: The first step is to select a pivot element, which is typically the first or last element in the array. 

    1. **Partition the array**: The next step is to partition the array into two parts: one part with elements less than the pivot and one part with elements greater than the pivot. This is done by using two pointers (left and right) that start at the beginning and end of the array respectively. The left pointer moves towards the right until it finds an element greater than the pivot and the right pointer moves towards the left until it finds an element less than the pivot. Then the elements are swapped.
    
    1. **Recursive sort**: The final step is to recursively sort the two partitions of the array. The quicksort algorithm is called recursively on the left partition (elements less than the pivot) and the right partition (elements greater than the pivot) until the base case is reached (an array of size 1 is already sorted).

    Here is an example of how the quicksort algorithm works on the array [8, 5, 2, 9, 5, 6, 3] with the pivot element being the first element 8:

        pivot = 8
        left pointer = 2
        right pointer = 3

        [8, 5, 2, 9, 5, 6, 3]
               L         R

        swap 2 and 3
        [8, 5, 3, 9, 5, 6, 2]

        Partition:
        left partition: [5, 3, 2]
        right partition: [9, 5, 6]

        Recursive sort:
        quicksort(left partition)
        quicksort(right partition)

        Sorted array: [2, 3, 5, 5, 6, 8, 9]

    In quicksort, the pivot selection and partitioning method can greatly affect the performance of the algorithm. A good pivot selection strategy is to choose pivot randomly or median of the array, this can help to avoid worst case scenario of O(n^2) when the array is already sorted or reverse sorted.

    Overall, quicksort is an efficient and popular sorting algorithm that uses a divide-and-conquer approach to sort an array. It has an average time complexity of O(n log n) and is relatively easy to implement.

1. **What is the difference between a directed graph and an undirected graph?**\
**Ans**. A directed graph and an undirected graph are both types of graph data structures, but they have some key differences:

    1. **Edge Direction**: In a directed graph (also called a digraph), each edge has a direction and connects one vertex to another. The edges have a specific starting vertex and a specific ending vertex. In an undirected graph, there is no direction on the edges and they connect two vertices without any specific order.

    1. **Weight**: The edges in directed graph can have weight, and it is possible to have different weights for different edges in a directed graph. But in an undirected graph, the edges are unweighted and all edges are considered to have the same weight.

    1. **Path**: In a directed graph, a path from vertex A to vertex B is a sequence of directed edges that starts at vertex A and ends at vertex B. In an undirected graph, a path from vertex A to vertex B is a sequence of edges that starts at vertex A and ends at vertex B.

    1. **Connectivity**: In directed graph, the connectivity between two vertices is defined by the directed edges between them and a vertex can be connected to another vertex but the other vertex may not be connected back. But in undirected graph, the connectivity between two vertices is defined by the edges between them and if a vertex is connected to another vertex, the other vertex is also connected back.

    In summary, a directed graph is a graph data structure where each edge has a direction and can have weight, and a path is defined by a sequence of directed edges. An undirected graph is a graph data structure where edges don't have any direction, are unweighted, and a path is defined by a sequence of edges.
    
1. **What is the time complexity of the Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm?**\
**Ans**. Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm is an algorithm for finding the shortest path between nodes in a weighted graph. It is a type of graph search algorithm that makes use of a priority queue to select the next vertex to visit based on the distance from the starting vertex. The algorithm is named after its creator, Edsger W. Dijkstra.

    Here's how the Dijkstra's algorithm works:

    1. **Initialize**: The algorithm starts by initializing the distance of the starting vertex to 0 and the distance of all other vertices to infinity. A priority queue is used to keep track of the unvisited vertices, with the priority being the distance from the starting vertex.

    1. **Visit vertex**: The algorithm visits the vertex with the smallest distance from the starting vertex in the priority queue. The distance of the neighboring vertices is then updated if a shorter path is found.

    1. **Update distance**: For each neighboring vertex of the current vertex, if the distance of the neighboring vertex is greater than the distance of the current vertex plus the weight of the edge connecting the two vertices, the distance of the neighboring vertex is updated to the current distance plus the weight of the edge.

    1. **Repeat**: The algorithm continues to visit the next vertex with the smallest distance from the starting vertex and update the distance of the neighboring vertices until all vertices have been visited.

    Here's an example of how Dijkstra's algorithm works on the following graph:

            A--2--B--3--C
            |\     |
            | \    |
            |  \   |
            |   \  |
            |    \ |
            |     \|
            3      1
            |      |
            D------E
    Let's say we want to find the shortest path from vertex A to vertex E.

        1. Initialize:
        distance of A = 0, distance of B = infinity, distance of C = infinity, distance of D = infinity, distance of E = infinity
        priority queue = {B, C, D, E}

        2. Visit vertex A:
        distance of B = 2, distance of D = 3, priority queue = {C, D, E}

        3. Visit vertex B:
        distance of C = 5, priority queue = {D, E}

        4. Visit vertex D:
        distance of E = 4, priority queue = {E}

        5. Visit vertex E:
        Shortest path from A to E = 0 --> 3 --> 4

    Dijkstra's algorithm is widely used for solving the shortest path problem. It has a time complexity of O(E log V) where E is the number of edges and V is the number of vertices. The space complexity is O(V) where V is the number of vertices.

    It is important to note that Dijkstra's algorithm can only be used on graphs with non-negative edge weights. For graphs with negative edge weights Bellman-Ford algorithm should be used.
