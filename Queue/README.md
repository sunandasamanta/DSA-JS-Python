# Queue - A Linear Data Structure

A queue is a linear data structure that follows the First In First Out (FIFO) principle, which means that the first element added to the queue is the first one to be removed. A queue has two main operations: enqueue and dequeue. Enqueue is used to add an element to the end of the queue and dequeue is used to remove an element from the front of the queue.

A queue has several properties that make it useful for solving many types of problems:

1. **FIFO**: A queue follows the First In First Out (FIFO) principle, which means that the first element added to the queue is the first one to be removed.

2. **Enqueue and Dequeue**: A queue has two main operations: enqueue and dequeue. Enqueue is used to add an element to the end of the queue and dequeue is used to remove an element from the front of the queue.

3. **Front and Rear**: A queue has a front pointer that points to the front of the queue and a rear pointer that points to the end of the queue. This allows for constant-time access to the front and rear elements.

4. **Empty and Full**: A queue can be implemented as an array or a linked list, and it can have a fixed size or be resizable. Queues can also be implemented as a dynamic array which automatically resizes when the queue becomes full.

5. **Practical Applications**: Queues are used in many applications such as scheduling tasks, handling interrupts, and simulating real-world scenarios such as waiting in line. They are also used in networking, resource management, and other practical applications.

6. **Implementation**: Queues can be implemented using various data structures such as arrays, linked lists, and dynamic arrays. Each implementation has its own advantages and disadvantages, depending on the application.

An example of a queue can be a line at the bank. The first person in the line is the first one to be served by the teller. If more people come, they join the end of the line(enqueue) and the person at the front of the line is being served(dequeue)

In summary, a queue is a simple but powerful data structure that follows the First In First Out (FIFO) principle. It has two main operations, enqueue and dequeue, which allows for constant-time access to the front and rear elements of the queue. Queues are widely used in many applications such as scheduling tasks, handling interrupts, networking and resource management.
