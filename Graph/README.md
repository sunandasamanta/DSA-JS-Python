# Graph - A Non-Linear Data Structure

A graph is a non-linear data structure that consists of a set of vertices (also called nodes) and edges that connect them. Vertices represent the elements of the graph, and edges represent the relationships or connections between them. Graphs can be used to represent many types of real-world relationships such as social networks, transportation networks, and web pages.

There are several types of graphs:

1. **Undirected Graphs**: In an undirected graph, the edges do not have a direction, and they are represented by a line connecting two vertices.

1. **Directed Graphs**: In a directed graph, also known as a digraph, the edges have a direction and are represented by an arrow pointing from one vertex to another.

1. **Weighted Graphs**: In a weighted graph, each edge has a value or weight associated with it. This value can represent the distance between two vertices or the cost of traversing an edge.

1. **Unweighted Graphs**: In an unweighted graph, edges do not have a value or weight associated with them.

1. **Connected Graph**: A graph is called connected if there is a path between every pair of vertices.

1. **Disconnected Graph**: A graph is called disconnected if there is no path between some pair of vertices.

1. **Complete Graph**: A graph is called complete if there is an edge between every pair of vertices

1. **Sparse Graph**: A graph is called sparse if the number of edges is much less than the maximum possible number of edges.

1. **Dense Graph**: A graph is called dense if the number of edges is close to the maximum possible number of edges.

Graphs can be traversed using various algorithms such as depth-first search and breadth-first search. They have a wide range of practical applications such as network routing, social network analysis, recommendation systems, in computer science, transportation and logistics and many other fields.

An example of a graph is a map of a city. Each vertex represents a location such as a building or a park, and the edges represent the roads connecting them. In this case, the graph is undirected because there is no direction on the road and weighted because each edge has a value or weight representing the distance between two locations.

In summary, a graph is a non-linear data structure that consists of a set of vertices and edges that connect them. It allows for the representation of complex relationships between elements and can be used to represent many types of real-world relationships. Graphs can be directed or undirected, weighted or unweighted, connected or disconnected and many other types. They can be traversed using various algorithms such as depth-first search and breadth-first search and have a wide range of practical applications.
