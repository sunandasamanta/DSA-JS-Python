# Stack - A Linear Data Structure

A stack is a linear data structure that follows the Last In First Out (LIFO) principle, which means that the last element added to the stack is the first one to be removed. A stack has two main operations: push and pop. Push is used to add an element to the top of the stack and pop is used to remove an element from the top of the stack.

A stack has several properties that make it useful for solving many types of problems:

1. **LIFO**: A stack follows the Last In First Out (LIFO) principle, which means that the last element added to the stack is the first one to be removed.

2. **Push and Pop**: A stack has two main operations: push and pop. Push is used to add an element to the top of the stack and pop is used to remove an element from the top of the stack.

3. **Top**: A stack has a top pointer that points to the top element of the stack. This allows for constant-time access to the top element.

4. **Empty and Full**: A stack can be implemented as an array or a linked list, and it can have a fixed size or be resizable. Stacks can also be implemented as a dynamic array which automatically resizes when the stack becomes full.

5. **Practical Applications**: Stacks are used in many applications such as evaluation of mathematical expressions, undo/redo functionality, and memory management in function calls. They are also used in parsing and syntax analysis, such as in compilers, and other practical applications such as web browsers, memory management, and many more.

6. **Implementation**: Stacks can be implemented using various data structures such as arrays, linked lists, and dynamic arrays. Each implementation has its own advantages and disadvantages, depending on the application.

In summary, stack is a simple but powerful data structure that follows the Last In First Out (LIFO) principle. It has two main operations push and pop, which allows for constant-time access to the top element of the stack. Stacks are widely used in many applications such as parsing and syntax analysis, memory management, and other practical applications.
