Trees are a fundamental data structure in computer science and are used to organize and manipulate data in various ways. There are several different types of trees, each with their own unique characteristics and uses. Understanding the different types of trees and when to use them is crucial for solving problems and designing efficient algorithms.

**Binary Tree**: A binary tree is a tree data structure in which each node has at most two children, which are referred to as the left and right child. An example of a binary tree is a family tree, where each person has at most two parents. A binary tree can be implemented using a Node class, which stores the left and right children of the node, as well as the value of the node.

    class Node:
        def __init__(self, data):
            self.left = None
            self.right = None
            self.data = data

In this example, a Node class is defined, which has three attributes: left, right and data. left and right are used to store the left and right child of the node, while data is used to store the value of the node. The class can then be used to create a binary tree by creating new nodes and linking them together as left and right children.

Binary trees have several use cases, one of the most common is in the implementation of a decision tree, where each node represents a decision and the left and right children represent the two possible outcomes of that decision. Binary trees can also be used to represent expressions, where each node represents an operator and the left and right children represent the operands.

**Binary Search Tree**: A binary search tree (BST) is a binary tree in which each node has a value that is greater than or equal to the values of its left children and less than or equal to the values of its right children. This property allows for efficient searching, insertion, and deletion operations. A common use case for a binary search tree is in the implementation of a dictionary, where each node represents a word and the left and right children represent words that come before and after it in the dictionary.

    class Node:
        def __init__(self, data):
            self.left = None
            self.right = None
            self.data = data

    def insert(root, data):
        if root is None:
            return Node(data)
        else:
            if root.data > data:
                root.left = insert(root.left, data)
            else:
                root.right = insert(root.right, data)
        return root

This example defines a Node class similar to the one for a binary tree, but also includes a function called insert, which takes a root node and a value as input and inserts the value into the BST. The function checks if the root is None, and if so, creates a new node with the input data. If the root is not None, the function compares the input data with the data of the root node and decides whether to insert the data as the left or right child of the root node. The function uses recursion and compares the input data with the data of the root node, if the data is less than the root data it recursively call the left subtree and if the data is greater than the root data it recursively call the right subtree.

**An AVL Tree**: An AVL tree is a self-balancing binary search tree. In an AVL tree, the heights of the two child subtrees of any node differ by at most one; if at any time they differ by more than one, rebalancing is done to restore this property. Lookup, insertion, and deletion all take O(log n) time in both the average and worst cases, where n is the number of nodes in the tree prior to the operation.

For example, let's say we have the following AVL tree:

    class Node:
        def __init__(self, key):
            self.key = key
            self.left = None
            self.right = None
            self.height = 1

    class AVLTree:
        def insert(self, root, key):
            # Step 1: Perform normal BST insertion
            if not root:
                return Node(key)
            elif key < root.key:
                root.left = self.insert(root.left, key)
            else:
                root.right = self.insert(root.right, key)

            # Step 2: Update the height of the ancestor node
            root.height = 1 + max(self.getHeight(root.left),
                                self.getHeight(root.right))

            # Step 3: Get the balance factor
            balance = self.getBalance(root)

            # Step 4: If the node is unbalanced, then try out the 4 cases
            # Case 1 - Left Left
            if balance > 1 and key < root.left.key:
                return self.rightRotate(root)

            # Case 2 - Right Right
            if balance < -1 and key > root.right.key:
                return self.leftRotate(root)

            # Case 3 - Left Right
            if balance > 1 and key > root.left.key:
                root.left = self.leftRotate(root.left)
                return self.rightRotate(root)

            # Case 4 - Right Left
            if balance < -1 and key < root.right.key:
                root.right = self.rightRotate(root.right)
                return self.leftRotate(root)

            return root
        
        def leftRotate(self, z):
            y = z.right
            T2 = y.left
            
            # Perform rotation
            y.left = z
            z.right = T2
            
            # Update heights
            z.height = 1 + max(self.getHeight(z.left),
                            self.getHeight(z.right))
            y.height = 1 + max(self.getHeight(y.left),
                            self.getHeight(y.right))
            
            # Return the new root
            return y
        
        def rightRotate(self, z):
            y = z.left
            T3 = y.right
            
            # Perform rotation
            y.right = z
            z.left = T3
            
            # Update heights
            z.height = 1 + max(self.getHeight(z.left),
                            self.getHeight(z.right))
            y.height = 1 + max(self.getHeight(y.left),
                            self.getHeight(y.right))
            
            # Return the new root
            return y

This code defines two classes, Node and AVLTree. The Node class has 4 attributes: key, left, right, and height. The AVLTree class has one main method, insert, which is used to insert a new node into the AVL tree. The insert method takes in two arguments, root and key, where root is the current root of the tree and key is the value of the new node to be inserted.

The insert method first checks if the root is None, in which case it creates a new node with the given key and returns it as the new root. If the root is not None, it then compares the key of the new node to the key of the root and if the key is less than the root's key, it recursively calls the insert method on the left subtree of the root. If the key is greater than or equal to the root's key, it recursively calls the insert method on the right subtree of the root.
